            <p class="aboutLeft">Disclaimer, this concept is purely fictional and is only related to one intended person with their knowledge and consensus.<br><br> The concept of Idol Tav started with the design. Obviously, there were multiple designs. Originally, I first came up witha  simple design based on this banner I had.</p>

            <p class="aboutLeft expo">///////////////////<br>A dark theme was used to portray a dark theme while the fair skin and white hair was to show that her external features were white (pure). However, instead of that shirt, it was planned to have a pure black long dress, while being taller and older.</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <p class="aboutRight">A second design came up to compare to the first. As there were no references this time, here was the version 1 sketch.</p>

            <p class="aboutLeft expo expo2">///////////////////<br>This is the current design. It was designed mostly from a redhead type, with sadism potential.</p>
            <p class="aboutLeft down">There was also design 3 (kure~pu on Danbooru), however in the end Tav herself gave a vague request about a red hair, tavern style setting, and Kira asked his friend @EmonPH to draw the logo (bottom). Thanks again~</p>
